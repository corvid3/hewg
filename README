# hewg
Build system infrastructure and package manager for C/CXX.

## what is hewg
Hewg is a combination of a few tools into a single binary. Hewg is a simple and
robust build system for C/CXX, which prefers to use config files rather than its
own DSL. Hewg also performs simple package management and versioned dependency
management for libraries written for hewg. Hewg aims to be simple to learn and
set in stone, rather than constantly adding features and bloat.

## how to build a project with hewg
In a directory with hewg set up, simply type `hewg build`. By default hewg
will select the current architecture as the build profile. Hewg will build all
artifacts and spit out the finished product in the `target` directory, under the
build profile which was selected.

## how to install a package with hewg
In the root directory of the repository that you wish to build and install,
run `hewg build --release`, and then `hewg install`. Hewg will automatically
manage creating files, directories, and marking the installed versions of a package.

## how to clean a repository from build artifacts
Simply run `hewg clean`. Hewg will remove all cached information of the project.

## packages
Each hewg "project" is a self-contained package. Every package is defined by
it's own `hewg.scl` in its root directory.  Each package is defined by both
the `hewg` and `project` tables in the `hewg.scl` file. The `hewg` table
defines meta information about the build system, such as  the package type
and the version of hewg used to build the package. The project table defines
general information about the package, such as name, a short description, a
list of authors, and the current version of the package. Package creators and
maintainers are very highly advised to follow semantic versioning,  as closely
as they can; as hewg performs dependency resolution by following semantic
versioning for compatibility.
