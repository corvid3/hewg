bootstrapping hewg is a bit of a process, as hewg relies on packages to be installed to be built.
luckily, the dependencies that hewg relies upon come with bootstrapping scripts to make this easy.
for each dependency, that is:
	* crow.scl
	* crow.jayson
	* crow.lexible
	* crow.datalogpp
	* crow.terse
(NOTE: all of these may be found at my github)
clone their respective repositories, and then run the `bootstrap.sh` found within.

once this is done, in the root directory of hewg, run 
	`make init-bootstrap`
	`make bootstrap -j` 
	`make install`.

once the bootstrapped version of hewg is installed,
go back to the dependencies and for each run `hewg-bootstrap build --install`.

once all of the dependencies are installed as packages, return to the hewg directory
and run `hewg-bootstrap build --install`.

if you wish to remove the bootstrapped version of hewg, run 
	`make uninstall`,
it will prompt you if you wish to remove the file and ask for a sudo password.

one may also wish to add `~/.hewg/bin` to their path, if they wish to do so.
